# Multiprogramming operating-system using java
# designed by: Group 7(CS-SEDA)


With Java, we created this multiprogramming operating system.
We can give it instructions in code to print in any shape, carry out mathematical operations, or reverse strings.

Program errors like Out of Data, Line Limit Exceeded, Time Limit Exceeded, Operation Code Error, Operand Error, and Invalid Page Fault may occur during the course of a job.
We have added PI interrupt for programming errors.
There won't be a physical breakÂ separating the two jobs.
In the output file, there will be two blank lines between each job output.
We have implemented operating system concepts like paging, real memory storage for the page table, and random number generator allocation of programme pages to one of 30 memory blocks.
One programme at a time, load and run
